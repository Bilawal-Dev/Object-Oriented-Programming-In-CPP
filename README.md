# Object-Oriented Programming in C++ Repository 👨‍💻📚

## The Next Step in My Software Engineering Journey 🚀

This repository represents a significant milestone in my software engineering journey. In my second semester at UET Mardan, I delved into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with C++. This course introduced me to essential OOP concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Mastering these concepts has deepened my understanding of software design and development and has been a critical step in my programming education.

## Description 📜

This repository contains the C++ code I wrote for my OOP Lab tasks during my second semester. It includes various programs and exercises that demonstrate my understanding and application of OOP principles.

## Importance of OOP & Its Advantages 🌟

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Abstraction**
- **Reusability**
- **Maintainability**

## Contents 📂

- **Classes & Objects:** Basic programs that introduce classes and objects.
- **Inheritance:** Examples demonstrating the use of inheritance to create hierarchical relationships.
- **Polymorphism:** Programs showcasing function overloading and dynamic polymorphism.
- **Encapsulation:** Exercises emphasizing data hiding and access control.
- **Abstraction:** Examples of abstract classes and interfaces.
- **Operator Overloading:** Programs that implement custom behavior for operators.
- **Templates:** Exercises involving template classes and functions.
- **Exception Handling:** Examples demonstrating error handling using exceptions.
